Yak uses ACF Pro to define a fully customizable **Theme Settings Panel**, accessible via:

```
Appearance → Theme Settings
```

### Available Panels:

- **Brand Colors** — Choose a base color and auto-generate accessible variants
- **Editor Color Palette** — Select which swatches should appear in the block editor

## CSS Architecture

Yak's CSS uses cascade layers and a clear file structure for maintainability and extensibility. See the `style.css` file for a detailed Table of Contents.

### Layer Structure:

- `RESET` — Normalize browser defaults  
- `BASE` — Root variables, typography, spacing, accessibility  
- `BLOCKS` — Gutenberg block styles  
- `LAYOUT` — Page structure, containers, breakpoints, featured overlays  
- `COMPONENTS` — UI elements (buttons, modals, navigation, etc.)  
- `UTILITIES` — Reusable utility classes  
- `OVERRIDES` — Optional last-layer tweaks  

CSS variables are declared globally and drive the entire design system, including spacing, typography scales, and color tokens like:

```css
--yak-color-primary
--yak-font-base
--yak-font-xl
--yak-padding-block
```
