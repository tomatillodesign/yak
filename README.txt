A fast, modern, developer-focused child theme built on the Genesis Framework — perfect for custom client builds with ACF Pro, advanced block styling, and powerful layout tools.

== Description ==

**Yak** is a lightweight, highly customized Genesis child theme created for modern WordPress development workflows. Built with accessibility, performance, and flexibility in mind, it serves as a rock-solid foundation for custom projects, particularly when paired with **Advanced Custom Fields Pro** and the **Genesis Framework**.

Yak includes carefully layered CSS architecture, robust block editor support, and a growing ecosystem of companion plugins (all GitHub-based). The theme is intended for developers and agencies who want full control over design systems, layout tooling, and editor behavior without bloated features or opinionated design defaults.

- ⚙️ **ACF Pro Required** (for theme options, blocks, and layout control)

- 🧱 Fully customized Gutenberg block support with refined editor styles
- 🧭 Mobile-first layout system with container queries and layout helpers

---

== Installation ==

1. Make sure the [Genesis Framework](https://my.studiopress.com/themes/genesis/) is installed and activated.
2. Make sure [Advanced Custom Fields Pro](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/) is installed and active.
3. Install and activate the Yak theme.
4. (Optional) Install recommended Yak companion plugins (listed in Appearance → Theme Settings → Plugins tab).

---

== Theme Settings ==

Yak uses ACF Pro to define a fully customizable **Theme Settings Panel**, accessible via `Appearance → Theme Settings`. Sections include:

- **Brand Colors** — Choose a base color and auto-generate accessible variants
- **Editor Color Palette** — Select which swatches should appear in the block editor
- **Typography** — Set base font size, ratio, line height system, and typefaces
- **Login Screen** — Customize background image or gradient, logo, and button style
- **Layout & Display Options** — Control featured image overlays, search UI, etc.
- **Plugin Recommendations** — Quick links and install status for Yak-compatible plugins

---

== CSS Architecture ==

Yak's CSS uses cascade layers and a clear file structure for maintainability and extensibility. See the `style.css` file for a detailed Table of Contents.

- RESET — Normalize browser defaults
- BASE — Root variables, typography, spacing, accessibility
- BLOCKS — Gutenberg block styles
- LAYOUT — Page structure, containers, breakpoints, featured overlays
- COMPONENTS — UI elements (buttons, modals, navigation, etc.)
- UTILITIES — Reusable utility classes
- OVERRIDES — Optional last-layer tweaks


CSS variables are declared globally and drive the entire design system, including spacing, typography scales, and color tokens (`--yak-color-*`, `--yak-font-*`, etc).

---

== Recommended Plugins ==

Yak is optimized to work with a growing suite of optional companion plugins:

- **Tomatillo Design ~ Info Cards**  
- **Tomatillo Design ~ Events Calendar**  
- **Tomatillo Design ~ AVIF Everywhere**  
- **Tomatillo Design ~ Site Manager Role**  
- **Tomatillo Design ~ Yakstretch Cover Block**  
- **Tomatillo Design ~ Simple Collapse**  

These plugins are listed and checked in the Yak Theme Settings under the Plugins tab, and can be installed directly via GitHub.

---

== Development Notes ==

Yak is built for serious WordPress developers who want full control:

- Modular PHP architecture for theme functions and editor logic
- ACF-based blocks and options pages with custom styling wrappers
- Accessible JavaScript enhancements via `yakstrap.js`
- Sensible defaults with minimal bloat
- GitHub-first plugin ecosystem

---

== Support ==

Yak is not a commercial product and does not include end-user support. Developers are encouraged to fork, extend, and customize as needed.

---

== License ==

This theme, like WordPress itself, is licensed under the GPL v2 or later.
